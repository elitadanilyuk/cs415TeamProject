# P1 Coverage Report

Overall, the team did a great job keeping a close eye on the test coverage. We completed the spring with 100% instruction and branch coverage. As a team, we could have done a better job keeping an eye on coverage from the start; although, we came back from a slow start to full coverage. We're excited to continue moving forward and to use JaCoCo in our future sprints.
