# P3 Reflection

This sprint's deliverables were smaller and the sprint felt shorter so the following reflection for the sprint is shorter.

### What went well
- Team communication and agreement on expected work over Spring break

### What didn't go well
- Team members who were assigned the aggregate tests were unable to work on the project until others were complete

### What would we do differently
- It would be helpful in the future if deliverables were set and clear at the beginning of the sprint
