# P5 Reflection

### What went well
- Team members helped each other through tasks during roadblocks
- We agreed to create use and test cases during their tasks
- We started early and were not pressed for time
   - Because of this we had time to add to the UI and add additional features

### What didn't go well
- Finding machines that weren't already running ports that we needed
- Learning curve for some team members with React
- Learning curve with DataService.js

### What would we do differently
- By this sprint, our team was performing and we don't feel that we would do things differently
